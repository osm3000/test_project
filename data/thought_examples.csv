"it would make me feel rejection, like i am not good enough",thought
"i should have thought it through, because we work together",thought
"i will have to accept the disappointment, and work with this person",thought
Why am i not good enough,thought
"i put six months into this job, and did not succeed, it is disappointing",thought
i would feel worthless,thought
i would need to find a job i can do better at,thought
"i need to work harder, find something i am better at",thought
"why is he acting like i am not important as other people, i haven't done anything wrong",thought
"i am being polite and friendly, why can't he?",thought
its not right to be treated that way.,thought
i feel like i should be treated better,thought
I am being disrespected,thought
"it means that these people not care about anyone but themselves, and i have to suffer",thought
i am going to have to deal with this poor behavior for a long time,thought
unless i go above and beyond these people are going to keep taking advantage,thought
its disheartening to deal with this stress,thought
it feels like it would never end,thought
I would feel irritated and feel that I am being micro-managed,thought
It would say that my boss does not have confidence in me that I can complete projects on time without reminders,thought
It might suggest that my boss thinks that I waste company time by taking long breaks/not on task,thought
It would make me wonder if my boss recognized the strength of my other work assignments,thought
My family must not understand my lifestyle.  They don't understand me.,thought
My family will think I am a bad person or that I don't value them.  ,thought
My family thinks that I all care about is work.,thought
Because someone else got a job that I would have been great at or that I believed was mine.,thought
It would mean that I am not as qualified as I think.,thought
It may mean that my acumen is clearly lacking.,thought
I may have to find an alternative career.,thought
I felt  frustrated and trapped because this person was not relying on any personal resources to solve their own problems,thought
It would mean that this person will have the impression that I will solve all of their problems in the future.  They might burden me.  ,thought
This person may cause me to miss out on other life experiences and things I need to prioritize because they are too demanding.,thought
"If this continues, this person may cause a lot of stress down the road.",thought
I must have given him a reason to stop speaking to me.  Maybe he thinks I am mean.,thought
It would mean that I may come across rude without being aware of it.,thought
It could mean that I showed too much interest and he now thinks I am clingy or desperate.,thought
"Feeling sad about how I have left mysef down and gained weigh instead of the intent to lose it. Like I have failed myself again, once by being that weight all together, and then when trying to lose it, gain more.",thought
"It would be to me that I dont have a handle on my life, or m goals in general. I would feel like I dont know how to be successful, or like all my efforts to do that will always fail",thought
"I am angry with myself for not doing the job the right way and getting hired for my efforts, or lake there of meeting those goals",thought
I would feel disappointed in myself and angry that I have caused this to happen. I would feel like I have let myself down by not learning how to be the best at that kind fo job. I would be thinking of the should have could haves in my head for a long time.,thought
"I am sad that my partner has left me, but even more devastated that it was done with a note and left a message of not even want to try to work it out. ",thought
"It would mean that the bases of what I thought out relationship was., was not true. I could have thought we meant more to each other then jsut leaving a note. A face to face would have at least made me feel like they cared deeply. Now I feel like it was all a waste",thought
I feel very low and like she doesnt even care anything about me as a person to just tell me to truth of her not being interested. ,thought
It makes me feel like what I bring to the table  in a relationship is very little. SO little that others dont even see me as someone they need to pay the respect in knowing why they no longer want to see or even talk to me. Like I am just a person who is not worth much of anything.,thought
"Disappointed, I thought I had made a better impression for them to remember me as I did them. ",thought
I like to get to know all types of people and try to remember them and enjoy there company. The fact that they did not waive or remember who I was makes me feel less then. Like I am not doing a good job at being a person people want to know and care about to remember they are a good person.,thought
I should of least lost a pound.,thought
I must of failed the diet somehow.,thought

People would start to drift apart.,thought
People would be less willing to support each other.,thought
Someone might suffer needlessly.,thought
"Well, I guess this is because only CICO works, why did I fall for this nonsense",thought
It would mean I made a stupid mistake,thought
It would mean I was gullible and lazy,thought
I'm wasting my time,thought
I've spent two hours with nothing to show for it,thought
It would say I should go do something else and come back to this,thought
This person is very rude,thought
I get really tired of trying to talk to people when they act like this,thought
It says that people are like this and it's no point talking to them,thought
You are a selfish ass to have done this to me,thought
Because it would mean I wasted all my love and concern on him for nothing,thought
It would mean he really was just selfish and I was an idiot for hoping otherwise,thought
Maybe he doesn't like me anymore,thought
It would mean I upset people,thought
It says that I'm not good at being a person,thought
The fact that I probably would be pressured the rest of the day puts fear in my body because I work terrible under pressure and this would be no exception.,thought
This means to me that I am a bad worker as I am not able to work under pressure .,thought
This tells me that I am not very good at my job .,thought
The fact that I let them down and feel like I am not good enough to be a apart of this family because I let them down.,thought
It means to me that I am a bad sibling/son if I am neglecting them for my job.,thought
It means to me that I am a terrible person and have low morals,thought
The fact that I was fired for not being my demands makes me fall into a deep depression of sadness.,thought
It means to me that I am incompetent and just not good enough at what I do honestly.,thought
it means that I am lazy and just a huge procrastinator. ,thought
I was ignored by someone while trying to start a conversation with them.,thought
I think this would say about me that I must not be very good socially and am a social outcast. It would mean to me that I must be an awkward person and destined to be lonely in life.,thought
I may not get the friends I want in life because of the lack of social skills,thought
The fact that she lied to me and played me for a fool. She did not intend to use the money for a bill rather her addictions.,thought
I was lied to and feel used. I feel like a kid tricked by his adult parent,thought
It would mean that I am just a gullible person and believe everything that happens to me.,thought

I'm not worth what i'm being payed,thought
It would mean that i'm wasting the companies time and resources,thought
"Wow, I can't believe i put in that much effort for these results",thought
It would seem as if i wasted my time,thought
It would mean i was bad a choosing the correct diet,thought
my sense of judgement is off,thought
i can't believe the relationship ended this way,thought
It says that i failed as a lover,thought

People are not going to enjoy being around me,thought
I will end up alone and depressed,thought

That I am not good enough,thought
I am not interesting enough for him.,thought
It would mean that he is better than me and I have nothing to offer him.,thought
They dont value my friendship,thought
Because it would mean I was at the bottom of the totem pole of friends,thought

That he sees me but is ignoring me,thought
It would mean that he didnt want to acknowledge that we know each other,thought
it would mean that he is embarrassed to know me,thought

being depressed and feeling bad about myself,thought

I really need a job.,thought

i did my best although i wasn't best,thought
loneliness,thought

The boss shouldnt be riding my ass,thought
I can stand having to deal with him all the time,thought
always anxious that hes looking over my shoulder,thought
Of course Im not good enough for her,thought
because being out of shape and ugly needs I never get a date,thought
because I constantly fail at losing weight and looking nice,thought
because it shows how much of a failure I am,thought
How did I fail so badly?,thought
I have failed. I suck at this job,thought
Im just not cut out for sales,thought
I need to find a new line of work,thought

I must be pretty boring to be treated like that,thought
I need to become more interesting,thought
stupid requesters not understanding how Mturk works ,thought
I got rejected because one thought I was going too fast,thought
It says Im a good turker and smart,thought
BAsed that I have work to finish. I was to complete my goals.,non-thought
Disappointment and commitment to improve,thought
BEcause I had a goal to improve my health and I failed for the week.,thought
Because its not necessary to be rude like that,thought
There's no need to act like that and then go to another group and talk normally to them.,thought
Because I didn't feel as if I was myself.,thought
I could have managed my emotions better regardless of how I felt when sick.,thought
No need to be rude when someone say's hello even if you're having a bad day.,thought
It means that I value interaction with others.,thought
"I'm not going to dig into someone's personal life if they are not interested in it.  Again, I keep to myself a lot so it is unlikely that I'd go and ask somebody out, especially one I JUST MET.  I like to get better acquainted with people at the workplace before doing any like that.  They don't know me, and whether they're truly busy or not is not of my concern.  Another option is that I'm just trying to move too quickly and it is making the other person feel awkward.  ",thought
Because I wasn't given any reason as to why I was unable to write any sentences.  Am I just stupid? Do I not know what my main assignment was that I had to write an essay to begin with?  Do I know what I'm supposed to write about but haven't because I haven't looked up any information about the topic?  I'm confused because this scenario is quite bad.,non-thought
"No, it wouldn't because it is true and i'm not upset.  I'm just annoyed that you think the scenario was good enough for me to interpret as something that happens to me.  This has never happened to me in my life of school and writing essays, so I cannot relate.  When asked to imagine the situation, it is impossible without more context because it is illogical to a person like me otherwise.",non-thought
"None of the four above really fits my emotion.  Rejection is a part of life.  If I fail again, you simply keep trying, especially when it comes to work.  People need income after all.  I don't have time to worry about things I cannot control in life.  You deal with it and move on to the next opportunity.",thought
"Once again, this is a scenario I can't really control.  I did my best, and whether the other person liked it or not is up to them.  Since I'm rather introverted anyway, I wouldn't be randomly talking with people at a party.  The way it was described seems the most awkward.  People are having fun around you and you walk up to someone with something you have no idea if they'd be interested in.  Someone like me would scope out people and their personalities prior or wait for an opportunity to fit my way into the conversation.  If I only did know my friend as well, chances are I'd hang with him when possible and he'd help me meet up with people.",thought
"Being unable to diagnose it, I've so far just let it happen.  It is definitely not a fear nor anger situation, just disappointment, which is the closest thing to sadness I suppose.  I cannot think of any other real world situation since nothing has happened that's caused any of these emotions, so this is all I could think of.  In any case, I do not like situations that I do not understand the rules of.  I've tried several things and have not quite figured out a solution to any of my issues.  It could be my ram, my motherboard, or just Windows 10 itself.  ",thought
"It is true, and it doesn't say anything about me specifically.  It is simply a difficult puzzle that needs solving and I'll get down to it eventually and have a nice healthy computer when its done.  Until then I'll continue to have some annoyances with it.",thought
I would feel like I wasted my time.,thought
I would feel like I failed.,thought
I fear I may not finish my essay in time.,thought
It means I am not proactive enough and I do not want to fail.,thought
I was worried that things would go wrong and we would have a fallout.,thought
I do not want to be on bad terms with relatives.,thought
It may change their opinion of me and would change our relationship.,thought
"Because we have always been close and friendly, and if something were to change that it would be sad.",thought
It says that I am afraid of hurting other peoples feelings.,thought
The feeling of being unwanted.,thought
It would hurt anyone to feel excluded.,thought
I was immediately resentful of him.,thought
Because it showed that he didn't care as much.,thought
I feel I have sacrificed much in the relationship and should be valued more.,thought
Failing to lose weight and instead actually gaining some,thought
Because it's the opposite of the objective I had for myself. I want to be able to achieve my goals.,thought
Family is hurt,thought
Because it's my family and I want them to be happy at all times. I love my family.,thought
If I'm not good at something better do something else,thought
I want to be able to chose a meal at least once,thought
She always makes those decisions and I have almost no say in the matter so it's upsetting. I want to also make choices.,thought
I get tired and get separated from her. I'd say I'm tired of having choices made for me.,thought
The feeling of rejection,thought
Means someone does not like me and it would say I want to be liked,thought
They think I'm lazy,thought
I could get fired,thought
I would stop making money,thought
I wouldn't be able to pay for necessities,thought
I would lose my home and my friends and would have to completely change my living situation,thought
They don't like me,thought
Something is wrong with me,thought
I didn't follow the diet correctly,thought
I'm a failure,thought
I'm unattractive,thought
No one wants to talk to me because they find me uninteresting unappealing,thought
I can't make friends,thought
I'll feel lonely and inadequate,thought
I'm ugly,thought
I wouldn't get as much attention from my significant other,thought
My significant other would become more attracted to better-looking people,thought
My significant other wouldn't be as interested in me anymore and I'd lose them,thought
I'd lose everything I built with my significant other and it would hurt my pride,thought
"I would have to move somewhere else, change my life and lose friends",thought
My boss doesn't trust my capabilities ,thought
I don't come across as being efficient ,thought
My superiors don't have faith in my work,thought
I will have no room for promotion,thought
I'll be stuck at a dead-end job forever,thought
My co-worker doesn't like me,thought

He doesn't care about my feelings,thought
I don't mean anything to him,thought
We would get divorced,thought
I'd be a single mom,thought
I'd be alone and more stressed,thought

I will be depressed and sad because I feel that I am worthless,thought
he pointed out that there was work to finish by the end of the day.,thought
he feels I cannot finish if I take a brief break for coffee,thought
I have a right to take a break,thought
My boss has no faith in me.,thought
I am a failure.,thought
It means I cannot lose weight,thought
I means I cannot stick to a diet so maybe I cannot stick to anything. ,thought

Happy that I dont have to think about this person in a social matter anymore.,thought
Anger at myself for not being able to come up with something to right,thought
It would say that i am hard on myself,thought
My fear of having no use in this world,thought

I would be angry because she just walked out on me.,thought

That I'm not talented enough.,thought
Mediocrity is something that scares me.,thought

Feeling sorry for that someone -not me- who doesn't know what they are missing!,thought
"Let's be honest, nobody likes to be turned down. Nobody likes to be told that you're not sexually attractive, specially on a Saturday night.",thought
I hate being used and I hate being taken advantage of.,thought

What could be wrong with me?,thought
There's a million things you may not like about somebody. Sometimes you can try and change certain things about yourself but not always.,thought
"Because not knowing the reason why somebody doesn't like you is frustrating, especially when you do like them.",thought
Because it is like they're not giving you the chance to prove you can be much more than what they see.,thought

"The worst that could happen would be having to stay late and my boss lecturing me in his office about time efficiency on the job. It would mean I'm inefficient with the basics of time management. This means my boss would feel he'd have to stay on top of me, and I'd feel I can't fit tasks in during the proper time.",thought
Feeling rejected by telling me he doesn't really have time these days.,thought
It would mean to me that he is giving me an excuse because he doesn't want to spend time with me. It would say about me that I am not as attractive as I thought I was.,thought
It would make me feel low on the totem pole of humanity. And it would denote I am lower on the pole than this man I liked.,thought
I've wasted this precious time here when I need to be productive.,thought
I would have been able to accomplish something else had I not wasted the time. It would mean I was incompetent for that stretch of time.,thought

It would mean I am not performing the duties of an adult properly. Time pressure is important in getting the tasks of school, life, and work done.",thought
Thinking they would not believe me despite not having free time for them.,thought
It would be upsetting because my family is my highest priority. I would not want them to think otherwise. And I believe they would feel this way. It says to me my family is extremely important.,thought
That after 30 years since I first started learning how to cook I am still ruining meals.,thought
That I don't learn from experience.,thought

This doesn't make sense.,non-thought
It would mean that I have to try header to get more tangible results.,thought
Things must have been that bad for her,thought
I must be harder to live with than I thought. What does this say about me as a partner? What's going on in her life?,thought
I must not have been doing a good job,thought
It would mean I'm not good at my job. I need to do better.,thought

I am completely undesirable.,thought
There is no point to even trying to make friends or go on dates because it will always end the same way.,thought

There is nothing special about me.,thought
I'd feel mad that they were pretending to my friend but they didn't really like me.,thought
I would feel like they were using me or trying to get advantages at work by being my friend. It would say that I'm not likeable or someone that others would want to spend their free time with.,thought

It would mean that I'm not being productive or working as hard as I should be. It would say that i'm lazy and not a hard worker,thought
That I'm a loser no one wants to hire me. I should just give up and stop trying to avoid being rejected,thought
It would say that I'm not qualified or the best candidate  so I should throw in the towel,thought
That I'm all alone and the person I loved never loved me so they left.,thought
It just proves that I'm not worthy of love. It says that I'm not worth investing time in and that I'm not good enough to put work into in order to improve our relationship. It says I'm unworthy of love or the effort to make the relationship work ,thought
I thought that I should have studied harder. If I knew enough information I would pass no matter how the standards changed. It was my fault I didn't try hard enough and was furious with myself,thought
I'm not a hard enough worker. I don't go above board to do more than I need to one the job. If I had the right work ethic I would have got this job but since I'm not an overachiever I missed out.,thought

This might very well be the last time... oh well.,thought

"And in the morning, I look over on the emptyside and frown.",thought
I think I may consider myself to be stupid and incompetent. ,thought
It would means that I'm not very intelligent. It would be a blow to my ego and sense of self worth. ,thought
"I wan't very good at the job. So, on one hand I felt a sense of relief. I could now find a job more suitable to me. I also sensed fear because I lost my job and had to seek new employment. ",thought

My family is hurt because of something I did.,thought
I do not prioritize my family over my own work.,thought
I may cause serious harm to my relationship with them.,thought
I will be sad and it will be my fault.,thought
"I tried hard for six months, but did not learn how to do my job well enough to be able to meet my quotas.",thought
I lack the natural ability to succeed at sales.,thought
I wasted six months on a job that I am not suited to.,thought
I have to find a different job,thought
I have to start over at the beginning with a new job,thought
I may end up making less money than I did before.,thought
Having less money will negatively impact my quality of life.,thought
My extreme reaction to the conflict was not proportionate to the minor disagreement,thought
I may have anger issues,thought
"Because my wife is divorcing me, anger issues could affect the future custody arrangement of my child.",thought
Losing custody of my child because of my anger issues would make my child and others think less of me.,thought
I must not be important enough for them to remember me.,thought
They don't value me as much as they ought to.,thought
"Previously I felt I liked them, and maybe that means I made a poor judgement of them.",thought

"The worst would be her not ever getting over her delerium, coming home and things being worse than they were before. It would mean being unable to work and unable to have what little bit of a life and hobbies i have right now. I have MS and have a lot of pain and fatigue. She didn't comprehend it before and wouldn't comprehend it now. I'd be completely unable to rest. I'd have to be around her for 24/7. The worst would be that she would forget who I was and get violent and hurt me or the pets. or she'd end up having to go to a home beause of something horrific she'd done. ",thought
It would mean that I would be utterly trapped here. It would say that I'd have to deal with it. ,thought
Them not understanding the situation. ,thought
It would be extremely upsetting. It would mean having to deal with their anger forever because my family holds grudges ,thought
Anger ,non-thought
Yeah it would be because this is true for me. ,thought
Being ignored would make me feel angry. ,thought
It would mean that I would most likely than not leave the party early since they were ignoring me anyway ,thought
Not knowing how she is going to be once she comes home in a few days terrifies me. ,thought
Extremely upsetting because it is the truth. It would mean nothing except i am a normal person because I am the one that is going to be home all the time and dealing iwth this. ,thought
"She gets violent, runs off by herself or hurts the house or the pets. ",thought
My boss thinks I am lazy,thought
I am in danger of being fired,thought
I will in fact be fired,thought

That I still have a target painted on my back for their abuse.,thought
It would say that I project weakness and invite abuse.,thought
I will not be able to pay the rent,thought

No one will talk to me,thought
I will have to slink away in shame,thought

 I am not a good partner at all.,thought
I am not worth keeping around as a partner.,thought
That I am headed for a breakup with my partner.,thought
I will be alone the rest of my life.,thought
Being interrupted by my boss and told of more work needing to be done,thought
It would kill any positive attitude I had at that time,thought
The possibility I wouldn't be able to do the essay,thought
It would mean that I'm unable to complete an assigned task,thought
I would be upset with them not understanding the situation,thought
It would mean that I'm negatively responding to their behavior,thought
The sudden breakup of a romantic relationship,thought
Everything I invested in the relationship would be for nothing,thought
It was probably a culmination of negatives thoughts about my boss being released at that moment,thought
It would say I have a lot of pent up anger,thought
Why does he need he think he needs to remind me?,thought
He thinks I am forgetful,thought
It would mean that I am not very good at my job,thought
If that is true then I might get written up,thought
I might get fired,thought
I would lose my apartment,thought
I would be homeless,thought
I would not be successful at life,thought
I would be a failure,thought
I'll never lose this weight,thought
If I never lose this weight then I will always be fat,thought
If I am always fat then I will never be as healthy as I want to be,thought
If I'm not healthy then I might get diseases related to obesity,thought
If I get diseases then I might get very sick,thought
If I get very sick I could die,thought
Because they want me to feel guilty for doing this to them,thought
It means they want to control me.,thought
 It means that they want me to seem like I did something wrong,thought
It makes it seem like I don't care about their feelings,thought
I am undesirable,thought
I am unattractive,thought
I would not be able to have the dating life I want,thought
I might be single forever,thought
I could die alone,thought
He doesn't like me,thought
Because I want people like him to like me,thought
If people like him don't like me then I don't feel included,thought
"If I don't feel included within social groups I like, then I won't have any friends",thought
If I don't have any friends than I will be lonely,thought
If I'm lonely then I won't be happy,thought
I lost my job,thought
I got fired and dont have income coming into my household now,thought
I may not be able to pay all of my bills on time.,thought
I might lose my house and my wife and family would have no where to go.,thought
My wife might leave me.,thought
I need a job and others keep getting them before me.,thought
I may not be a good candidate for some reason.,thought
I may not ever get a job.,thought
I wont make any money if I do not get a job.,thought
I wont be able to afford a place to live or a new car.,thought
I wont be able to move forward with my wife in life and have our own things.,thought
I am unable to keep my wife happy and now she left.,thought
I may not be able to restore my marriage.,thought
I will be divorced.,thought
I may not be able to find someone else again.,thought
Can we afford to start this process so soon?,thought
We do not have the money and lose our earnest money before we can build the house.,thought
We lose the property and and my wife is very upset.,thought
my wife would be upset I didnt work harder.,thought
She would get mad and leave me.,thought
I would be alone,thought
What is wrong with me that would cause them to ignore me?,thought
There is something wrong with me that people do not like.,thought
It will be hard for me to fit in.,thought
I will be lonely and not have friends.,thought
I already know what I need to do and don't need to be interrupted on break to be reminded by an overly fussy or overbearing supervisor. ,thought
It says I have little patience for authority figures. ,thought
I don't like being unnecessarily told what to do. ,thought
I don't like it when people needlessly display their authority.,thought
I'm very touchy about people trying to act dominant.,thought
I don't like being dominated so I should push back or remove myself from those situations.,thought
It's sad they weren't interested in a more involved relationship.,thought
"I really liked them, so tried to get to know them better.",thought
I was interested in forming a friendship. ,thought
I found them to be of interest on an emotional or psychological level.,thought
I hated this job anyway and have several grievances regarding the business and standards of the establishment.,thought
That I didn't like the job or commit to it enough to make it work. ,thought
That I only took the job and stayed that long to explore a topic of interest. ,thought
That I sometimes waste too much time following a path looking for data. ,thought
That I can be more than a bit compulsive about investigating odd byways of thought. ,thought
I don't get to see my son as often as I would like to as it is. ,thought
It says that divorce is hard and not being able to see my son as often as I would like is troubling. ,thought
It says I wish I could spend more time with my son and I wish I could have the kind of family unit I wanted. ,thought
I wonder why they reacted the way they did. ,thought
Frustration that I can't write anything,thought
I would feel like a failure,thought
It means I'm  not trying hard enough,thought
I'm not working as hard as I should,thought
It means that I'm not working to the best of my abilities,thought
That I'm having trouble focusing at the task at hand,thought
I'm letting myself be distracted,thought
I'm sad that my family feels hurt,thought
I don't want to hurt their feelings,thought
It means I was insensitive to them,thought
That I'm selfish,thought
It means I'm not a caring person,thought
It says I only care about myself,thought
It means I have to put my needs aside and think about others,thought
It means I have to make amends to the people I've hurt,thought
It means I feel bad for hurting their feelings,thought
It means that I have to work hard to show them I care,thought
I would feel like a failure,thought
It would mean I didn't work hard enough,thought
I may not get another job,thought
I will have trouble paying my bills,thought
It will cause me great stress,thought
"If I'm stressed, I'll have trouble getting another job",thought

If I can't pay my bills I may become homeless,thought
what's wrong with me?,thought
no one wants to talk to me,thought
I don't know why people don't want to speak to me,thought
I would feel bad about myself,thought
I would withdraw from people,thought
I would become depressed,thought
I would feel that I am not worth anything,thought
I would feel increasingly lonely,thought
I feel I'm unworthy of happiness,thought
life would not be worth living,thought
I'm mad at myself for being careless,thought
I should have planned better,thought
It means I wasn't focused,thought
It means that I'm a failure,thought
I'm not putting my full effort into my work,thought
It says I'm not performing well at work,thought
My boss will be unhappy,thought
He will give me a bad review,thought
My work quality will be watched closely,thought
If I keep making mistakes I could be fired,thought
I may have trouble finding another job,thought
I will have financial trouble,thought
Maybe they don't really like me,thought
"Maybe there's something wrong with me, like I'm annoying",thought
Maybe I over-read the situation and now I'm embarrassed,thought
I hope they don't think I'm crazy,thought
I'm wasting time,thought
"Yes, because I want to do other things with my time",thought
I am uninspired and need to break through the block,thought
I'm in an rut overall and I need to fix it,thought
I think I'm a failure,thought
Yes. I would be depressed and worthless.,thought
I wouldn't be able to pay my bills.,thought
I would have to ask for help and lose my independence.,thought
My heart is broken,thought
It hurts,non-thought
I'm now alone and lonely,thought
Now I have to start over again,thought
There's something wrong with me if he left so I'm afraid to start over,thought
My feelings are hurt and I'm confused and lost,thought
I guess he doesn't like me anymore,thought
I wonder what I did wrong,thought
I feel silly for getting my hopes up for him,thought
its only a pound and the question didnt state whether they had been exercising or not so it isnt a dead end,thought
i would want to see my family if i could,thought
i enjoy spending time with them,thought
i have a problem with anxiety / depression,thought
i would just take it as a reflection of who i truly am and as a trait i couldnt change,thought
idk might be tied to anxiety,thought
its a trait ill deal with for the rest of my life,thought
all he did was wave thats not exactly an attention getter,thought
"I was just simply trying to relax and take a break, I didn't need to be reminded that is still work to be done, as if I not a hard worker. ",thought
"Because it indicates that I don't work harder enough, when I know that my standard of work is much higher then others. ",thought
It would mean that my boss doesn't see the value I bring to the company. ,thought
"and because they don't recognize my value or thins I may be lazy or that I don't work hard enough, then maybe I want get a raise, a promotion or maybe I will be fired. ",thought
It's silly that their taking this so personally. ,thought
Because it's just silly for them to take me being to busy personally...I didn't say I didn't  want to see them at all ,thought
They continue to stay made at me.,thought
It puts a strain on our relationship. ,thought
We end up not speaking for years.,thought
shoot,non-thought
"I am frustrated because I know what my standards are and would be upset because I din't meet those standards for myself, plus now I have to look for a new job. ",thought
"It would mean I was incapable of doin a good job, when it comes to sells, or wasn't given enough time to prove myself, or I just don't have that skillset. ",thought
I need to maybe take a class in sells or business or just find a new line of work. ,thought
"I find new employment, that doesn't involve sells. ",thought
"Because I takes time, it can stressful and I need to stay financially secure.",thought
"Being rejected, not accepted and being apart or belonging.  ",thought
I'm make no new friends and end up having a crappy time at the party. ,thought
I go home alone and decide to not accept any future invitation to any other parties.,thought
I become extremely secluded and un-social. ,thought
I develop no meaningful relationships. ,thought
I die alone.,thought
This situation just keeps getting worse. ,thought
"Mean no I have to pay more money, thats not in my budget, because I was being irresponsible.",thought
just mean I'm more stress and more frustrated with myself and the situation. ,thought
I do not have enough information or motivation to write.,thought
It would mean I don't have the skills to complete this.,thought
I will fail the assignment.,thought
I am a failure in general.,thought
I am inconsiderate to my family.,thought
It means I am not a good son.,thought
My family wont love me.,thought
I will die alone.,thought
I didn't sell enough cars.,thought
I would be fired due to incompetency.,thought
I would lose my home,thought
I would have to panhandle.,thought
I would fall into drug addiction.,thought
I would die.,thought
I wasn't interesting enough to get their attention.,thought
I am boring.,thought
I will lose all of my friends.,thought
I will never find a wife.,thought
I will die alone.,thought
I am not a desirable partner.,thought
It means people don't want to be with me.,thought
I will not find a partner.,thought
i'm not working hard enough,thought
no because everyone needs breaks and my boss wasn't working when he was reminding me,thought
i'm always going to be fat,thought
yes no matter what i try it doesn't work,thought
i'll never be normal,thought
i don't even want to be here but i'm trying,thought
it means i'm doing what society says,thought
my relative thinks i'm lazy and need things to do,thought
they don't know me or my life at all and think i owe them,thought
i don't spend much time with them,thought
he doesn't like me,thought
i guess the feeling isn't mutual,thought
i was probably talking too much when we met and didn't pay attention to what he was thinking,thought
i need to pay attention to others more,thought
my boss reminded me of some work I need to turn in today,thought
This may mean that he doesn't trust me to turn the work in on time,thought
He must also not trust my judgement and follow through on assignments,thought
Bosses tend to fire people they don't trust,thought
Without a job I might lose my house if I can't find a new one soon,thought
I am trying to get more healthy and the opposite of that is happening,thought
Maybe I am doing this wrong and I need help to make these diet changes,thought
If I can't control my diet what else am I unable to do by myself,thought
Maybe I am stupid if I can't do things by myself,thought
I feel like I owe my family more but my job is how I sustain my lifestyle.,thought
It would mean that I prioritize my money over my family,thought
Maybe this means that I am evil as money is the root of evil,thought
If I am evil then I need to seek prayer and counseling and pray for forgiveness.,thought
I am thinking about how I will never see her again,thought
I spent a lot of time with her and I would have liked to speak with her to find out why.,thought
Because I loved her and I don't know what I could have changed.,thought
I missed part of a big presentation which I was supposed to be leading,thought
Because it makes me look incompetent and like I have poor time management skills,thought
This could lead my managers to never allow me to lead presentations,thought
This might stunt my career growth and keep me from moving up in my career.,thought
That I am taking a break from work.,thought
"I would think that they are probably telling the truth and that they are busy, but I would feel a little  bummed out.",thought
"It would mean not a whole lot to me, some people are just busy. I would not let it get to me.",thought
I would feel sad that I just lost my job.,thought
It would mean I did not do a good enough job too keep my job. It would say that I am probably not a good salesmen.,thought
I thought about all the years my neighbor was there and how there were leaving made me sad.,thought
It would mean I am saddened by things changing. It would say about me that I am connected to the people around me and feel sad when they are gone.,thought
"I would think why did they not respond back to me, did I do something wrong.",thought
It would mean that maybe that person does not like me or was not really paying attention. I would not let it get to me too much.,thought
I am ashamed.,thought
I would think that I feel bad for what I said or make him feel bad for making me feel this way.,thought
why have I ended up gaining weight?,thought
that everything I set out to do was not worth anything.,thought
because I did not do better.,thought
I would feel bad for myself when I wasted an opportunity.,thought
I do not understand this decision making.,thought
it means that I would be out of a job to which I dedicated two years of my life.,thought
I have said something bad?,thought
It would give me a bit of anguish to know why he reacted in that way.,thought
I feel like they were just saying that because I was on break.,thought
"I would feel taken advantage of. I have the right to take my breaks at work and as long as I am not breaking the law, they should leave me alone until my break time is over. ",thought
I would be disappointed and sad because they obviously don't feel the same was towards me as I do towards them. ,thought
It would be very upsetting because nobody wants to feel unliked or rejected. It would make me have doubts about myself and reduce my self esteem.,thought
It could lead me into falling into a depression. I always have cared too much about what other people think of me. ,thought
I would be worried and scared that I won't be able to find a job soon. I have bills I need to pay.,thought
It would be a terrible situation. Essentially in the end I could lose everything and not have a place to live or food to eat. A job is essential to life. ,thought
I would be embarrassed or sad not having anyone to talk to. I would feel like I didn't belong there.,thought
"It would make me super uncomfortable and unable to enjoy myself at the party. I am very shy so talking to people I don't know is very hard, especially when they aren't very responsive.",thought
Feeling like my mom and I weren't close anymore makes me very sad,thought
I love my mom and feel like she is my best friend. If we grew apart I would feel very lonely and like something is missing or incomplete.,thought
I would never want to live without my mom involved in my life. She is a supportive and constant person in my life.,thought
I'm never going to make a good car salesperson.,thought
I won't be able to get another job as a car salesperson.,thought
I can't pursue my dream.,thought
I'm not hireable.,thought
I'm never going to get a job.,thought
I won't be able to have a stable life.,thought
I'm push people away in relationships.,thought

I'll be alone for the rest of my life.,thought
I'm not an interesting person to talk to.,thought
I won't make friends.,thought
I'll stop socializing regularly.,thought
My opinions aren't valuable.,thought
I have worthless thoughts that no one cares to hear.,thought
I'm not an intelligent person.,thought
I am not an interesting person.,thought
People do not want to be around me,thought
I am not worthy of other people's time or attention,thought
Nobody will ever like me.,thought
I will always be lonely and never have friends.,thought
I can't do anything right. There's something wrong with my body.,thought
"No matter how hard I try, I can't reach my weight-loss goals. I will never look more attractive.",thought
I will always feel fat and be unattractive to others.,thought
I will never have a high self esteem. My spouse probably doesn't think I am sexy anymore.,thought
I am incompetent and incapable of keeping a job.,thought
I am a lazy employee with subpar work skills.,thought
I am not going to be able to pay my bills because of my own incompetence.,thought
"I could lose my home, and possibly my husband and children.",thought
I am so unorganized and my spouse never listening to me only makes it worse.,thought
My spouse doesn't care about my goals. I will never get my degree.,thought
My spouse probably doesn't love me anymore. I will never make enough money to live comfortably.,thought
My marriage is failing. I am unable to give my child a good life.,thought
I am not respected by this person.,thought
The people I associate with do not have consideration for my feelings.,thought
I am not worthy of respect. This person thinks they are better than me.,thought
I should be more careful about who I associate with.,thought
"I know about the work that has to be done, there's no need to remind me.  ",thought
IT would just mean that I was annoyed.  I would think my boss is an irritating jerk who hounds people.  I don't think this would say anything in particular about me.  ,thought
What a waste of time this diet has been and I've been sacrificing and working hard for nothing.,thought
IT would mean all my efforts had been wasted and I was just doing a bunch of sacrificing for nothing.  This would just be irritating and frustrating.,thought
"I don't think it would say anything about me personally, but it would say that the diet I chose was not working and I Needed to find a new one that worked.",thought
I feel very sad that this relationship has ended and it feels like there's no hope to fix it so my life will suddenly be completely different,thought
"It would mean that everything in my life was suddenly going to change, since I depend on my partner for many things including friendship, companionship, father to our children, provider.  It would mean that they don't really love me and find me to be unlovable.",thought
It would mean that I would be left trying to put my life back together and recreate a new life.  It would mean that I am unlovable to some people.,thought
"I shouldn't be so hard on her, especially when she is working hard to do things the way we want her to.",thought
"I am being an extremely critical parent, just like my parents were with me, and I need to back off and be more understanding and less critical.  ",thought
I would turn out to be like my parents!!  OMG!  And be very critical and make her feel like she could never be good enough.  That would be terrible bc it's the exact opposite of how I want to be.,thought
"I've always strived to be the opposite of them, so that would mean I am failing at this.",thought
I feel stupid that I waved at them and thought they were worthy of acknowledgement but they didn't feel the same about me.,thought
It would be upsetting.  It would mean that maybe people don't value me or find me to be a worthwhile person or someone worthy of acknowledging.,thought
It might mean that I am not very interesting or don't have likable characteristics as much as I think I do.,thought
It might mean that my self-assessments are totally inaccurate and I totally suck as a person.,thought
I am a responsible person and he does not acknowledge that,thought
I could not make him see that I am a responsible person,thought
He does not trust me,thought
I may not get a promotion,thought
I am doing something wrong,thought
I am failing on my diet,thought
I am a failure,thought
I would not want to hurt them,thought
I may have done something bad,thought
I am not a good person,thought
He should have discussed it with me face to face,thought
I would try to understand the problem,thought
He did not give me a chance to understand or try to fix things,thought

I would have to reevaluate my reasons and plans for my current career goals.,thought
I would have to pursue something less challenging and less lucrative.,thought
I would feel like I wasn't living up to my potential.,thought
I was insensitive to not think how they would feel at my request.,thought
It would mean that I was being a little selfish and thinking of my own schedule as more important than making time for my family member.,thought
It would mean I did not consider the feelings of my family members.,thought
I don't have to be in this high pressure situation any longer.,thought
I am not good enough and didn't try hard enough.,thought
It would mean my spouse didn't think it was worth trying to work things out if I wasn't right for them.,thought
"If I wasn't right for them, or we weren't right for each other, it would mean I invested a lot of time and energy into something and was completely wrong about it.",thought
If I was wrong about it it would show I was irrational or a little stupid to not see that it was a mistake.,thought
I always let myself get overwhelmed and distracted when work needs to be done.,thought
It would mean that I am unable to do the kind of work required of my program.,thought
If I am unable to do the work then I will not pass and will not get the kind of job I want.,thought
"If I can't get work in this field I am afraid of only being able to get hourly, physically demanding work such as factory or retail.",thought
I must have mis-read my co-worker's feelings.,thought

I've been selfish and not appreciative of all my family has done for me.,thought
I'm not a very good person.,thought
He shouldn't assign me a task if he doesn't trust my work.,thought
If my boss doesn't trust my work it means he thinks I am doing a bad job,thought
I'll never be able to work dependently and I'll always have to run every decision and choice by him.,thought
My work won't ever really be mine and I won't be able to move up in the company.,thought
I'll be stuck in a tedious position with a boss that doesn't respect my work.,thought

It would mean that I don't have a great and outgoing personality.,thought
It would mean that I can't have a lot of friends.,thought
I am stupid.,thought

I don't belong here.,thought
I would leave the party.,thought

I'd probably drink until I did something that I would later regret.,thought
That regret would create a shame spiral that may take days to extricate myself from.,thought
I'm not attractive enough.,thought
That a person who claims to love me is more concerned with her own pleasure than my safety.,thought
I've been making emotional investments that will never produce a return.,thought
Our relationship has peaked and we should consider breaking it off.,thought
We will break up and I will return to the interpersonal starting line with another person but with life weighing even heavier.,thought
I was embarrassed that he caught me taking a break,thought
I want my boss to think of me as very hard working,thought
"If he didn't think I was hard working, I would be afraid of losing my job.",thought
This is never going to work for me.,thought
"Yes, it would mean I am not successful in things I am trying to do.",thought
I feel guilty and disappointed in myself for letting them down.,thought
It would be upsetting that I showed a higher priority than my family.,thought
It would make me look selfish,thought
I want my family to think positively of me,thought
I would have lost my best friend and partner.,thought
It means I love my husband and want to spend my life with him,thought
I do so much around here and you are harping about the cutting board?,thought
I felt unappreciated,thought
I don't understand why this diet hasn't worked,thought
I am frustrated that I tried hard and nothing came of it,thought
I don't understand if this was a fault with me or the diet,thought
I don't know the answer and now I have to figure it out,thought
Not living up to standards,thought
I would feel inadequate ,thought
I could do better ,thought
I am not trying hard enough,thought
This is unfair,thought
Because I don't deserve this,thought
Because I worked hard to avoid this situation,thought
Because I don't know what to change to make it better,thought
Why did I overact like this,thought
Do I have trouble controlling my emotions,thought
Am I a person with emotional difficulties ,thought
Have I overreacted in other situations without realizing it?,thought
Have I hurt other people without realizing it?,thought
Am I a bad person?,thought
Maybe he does not like me,thought
Perhaps he thinks negatively of me,thought
What did I do to make him feel this way,thought
I don't know the answer and that bothers me,thought
There is nothing I can do and I am left alone wondering,thought
I would be frustrated with my brain and worried that I've lost my ability to write.,thought
It would say that maybe my creative ability is gone.,thought

It would mean that I was not a worthwhile person.,thought
It would mean that my life is basically pointless.,thought

It would mean that I felt disrespected by this rude man.,thought
It would mean that he didn't think I was worthy of his time or consideration.,thought
It would say that I'm not up to his standards.,thought
It would make me feel inferior.,thought
"I felt the criticism was unfair because they didn't take into account the entire situation, especially considering how the patient was behaving towards me.",thought
I felt they were purposely attacking me because I am a lowly employee and they have a the customer is always right attitude.,thought
I felt betrayed by my manager.,thought
I believe that after this I saw my manager differently. I lost confidence in her.,thought
It made me feel that I can't trust my initial judgements about people.,thought
I would worry that I unknowingly offended them.,thought
I would feel insensitive that I did something offensive and don't even realize it.,thought
"I would feel like a clumsy, unconscious person.",thought
I would feel like I'm not in tune with other people's feelings.,thought

He doesn't like me.,thought
I would feel like something is wrong with me. It could show my insecurity.,thought
It would hurt my feelings to think that he doesn't like me. I would wonder if I had done something to cause it.,thought
Not being able to complete the assignment on time and getting a late grade. ,thought
The worst would be failing on the assignment due to late submission. ,thought
The thought of being out of work for long and losing pay. ,thought
It would mean being out of work and going through the sturggle of finding another job.,thought
I feel angry because I am unable to find a guest to talk with and hold a conversation. ,thought
It is upsetting because it makes me feel awkward and embarrassed as I feel alone in a party. ,thought
I felt left out and singled out in the office and wondered if the person had a personal grudge against me.,thought
It is upsetting because I have to face the embarrassment at work when people ask me why I wasn't at the party when the rest of the coworkers were invited. ,thought
it's humiliating to not get acknowledgement from a person when i wave to him in a friendly way. ,thought
I would ignore the person the next time I see him at a social gathering and probably tell some friends about the incident to ease my pain. ,thought

"Clearly the boss is overreaching their authority, signalling to me to cut short my break that I'm entitled to take.",thought
"A micromanaging dictatorial boss doesn't understand, just because I'm taking a break doesn't mean I'm not getting work done.",thought
Such behavior usually repeats itself creating an annoying boss to work for.,thought
I might have to either find another job with a better boss else be miserable or find some way to communicate to the boss to chill out.,thought
Said boss's usually aren't reasonable and trying to communicate calmly to avoid micromanaging could make me an appear like an antagonist.,thought
I will have to find a new job if I ruin my relationship with the boss.,thought

Without feedback It'll be a struggle to guess how do whats correct in order to get a job.,thought
I'll be unemployed for awhile unless I lower my standards and accept a low quality job.,thought
That person probably just has different taste in conversation or a specific objective on their mind that I'm intruding on.,thought
"He's a nice guy, but I don't want to be friends with him any more as he's putting no effort into not being completely boring.",thought
"I want to explain to him he's absolutely a snorefest, but that would be a painful conversation and he might not take it right.",thought
"This would open up pandoras box, into back and forth criticizing that might end the relationship itself.",thought

I have a lot to write but can't think of anything.,thought
Having the ideas in your head about what to say but not being able to put them to paper is frustrating.,thought
Don't be mad about it if I ask you to postpone your visit I have time constraints to.,thought
"Because I also have a life and things that I need to take care of, and potentially can't always cater to someone elses schedule not lining up with mine.",thought
"You couldn't tell me to my face, you had to write a letter and leave while I was gone?",thought
I feel if a relationship got to the point of living together the connection would be strong enough that couples could atleast talk to each other about problems.,thought
Why would you wait until the last minute to ask me this.,thought
"Because I was there all day and could have easily started on this task earlier in the day, but he waited until almost the end of the day to ask me if I could stay longer to do it.",thought

"If he reprimands me, I might lose my job.",thought
I think my co-worker might not like me.,thought
It would bother me to find out that I am not liked.,thought
It would make the working environment awkward to know someone doesn't like me.,thought
I think they might be overreacting. ,thought
They might be trying to get attention by overreacting this way.,thought
They think maybe I would change my mind by acting this way.,thought
They are being manipulative to get me to change my plans.,thought
I was bad at this job and failed at it.,thought
"I was unable to learn and perform this job properly, it would be scary for future jobs.",thought
"It would mean for other jobs, I would be more prone to fail.",thought
It was unfair that I was the one to get in trouble for defending a weaker person.,thought
It means that other people can do despicable things and not be accountable.,thought
"If I was victim to an act from someone else at work, my bosses would not care.",thought
My coworker said no to hanging out because she doesn't like me.,thought
It means the relationship doesn't exist.,thought
Means I'm not worth knowing in real life.,thought
I'm a loser.,thought
Gave me a chance and took it away just like that.,thought
I wasted my time at a job I didn't need.,thought
I'm not a great worker.,thought
Everyone is telling me no and refuses to say they just didn't want to hire me.,thought

I have a short fuse.,thought
I get angry easily over small things.,thought
it's common to fluctuate a couple of pounds when on a diet.,thought
it wouldn't mean anything. it's normal to fluctuate a couple of pounds week to week. ,thought
i would keep an eye on the weight as time passes.,thought
i can't even take care of my own family,thought
it says i'm a pathetic individual,thought
it means i am not capable of taking care of my family,thought
it means i shouldn't raise my own family,thought
i should take care of my current family before even thinking of raising my own,thought
it says i need to learn to manage my time better,thought
i'm never gonna get a job. ,thought
because it makes me feel worthless,thought
because it will be difficult for me to find a job,thought
because i won't have any money to pay bills,thought
then i will be homeless.,thought
it will be the end of me if that happens,thought
i have no idea what i have done that is so wrong,thought
It means I am so clueless i can't even figure out how to please a woman,thought
it means i'm not capable of being a desirable man,thought
it says i should just be alone,thought
i would be devastated but will eventually be ok ,thought
i would be alone just as i am right now. ,thought
it says i'm not meant to find anyone.,thought
i would probably die alone. ,thought
maybe she doesn't like me anymore.,thought
i guess she won't be the last one who doesn't like me,thought
there has been many people who stopped being friends with me ,thought

maybe i'm a bad friend,thought
i hardly ever spend any time with them,thought
it says i'm a loner.,thought
i prefer to be a loner,thought
i'm probably gonna be a loner for the rest of my life. ,thought
i'll probably die alone. ,thought
so do many other people. i guess it means i am ready to accept that fate,thought
id feel inadequate,thought
It would mean i was not able to learn a new skill in time to keep a job,thought
that i was not smart enough to learn a new skill ,thought
im a loser,thought
I would be irritated I could not land a job,thought
Then i couldnt take care of my family,thought
my fiance might leave me,thought
the thought of not having my partner anymore is not a reality i want to live in,thought
Id be depressed and desperate to get her back,thought
trying to get her back may push her further,thought
her being gone makes me enter a depression,thought
depression makes me think id be better off dead,thought
Because i was letting her down and she felt pressured by my actions,thought
She could want to leave and find a partner that made more money,thought
Maybe he doesnt like me,thought
maybe im not likeable,thought
i have a skewed vision of what my friendliness comes off like,thought
"I have something I need to get done, so I am going to buckle down and get it done!",thought

i'm not good enough,thought
it would mean all my years of preparation hadn't been enough.,thought
i have been quite lazy,thought
he took me for granted!,thought
I am not imposing enough.,thought
I appeared to be too soft.,thought
i'm embarrassed.,thought
i'm unimportant to him ,thought
annoying,non-thought
It would bother me to be reminded of the work if I'm taking a break from it.,thought
"because when wanting to de-stress a bit, they remind me of what I'm trying to forget for a few minutes.",thought
I think it would make me a little less efficient at work.,thought
rejection,thought
I would feel rejected and sorry for the offer that I could not accept.,thought
I would think about what I am meddling with in his life and that I should not have asked him for such a thing.,thought
disappointed,non-thought
"I would feel bad for myself, knowing that my efforts were in vain.",thought
I think it would be a bad way to continue with the diet again.,thought
because in this way I would not know what else to do to do well what went wrong.,thought
sadness,non-thought
I do not like to make people I want feel bad,thought
this is why it makes me feel a bad person with those people who only want a good for me,thought
disagreement.,non-thought
because I could not make my partner agree that my option is better.,thought
that the project be dissolved by this discussion.,thought
the profit and the profits for both us and the company are too great to lose the option.,thought
I'm not interesting enough to want to do something with,thought

"I would be sad not being able to see my family, and I would also be sad that they were upset by the last minute cancellation. ",thought
"I would feel like a failure because I had been fired, regardless of the reasoning behind it. ",thought
It would mean that I didn't have what it took. I didn't work hard enough to accomplish the quota goals. That is not speaking well of my work ethic and ability to catch on to the job and tasks at hand. ,thought

Why did he not wave back?,thought
"It would be upsetting, just trying to say hi.  Then I would think to myself \why didn't he wave back? Does he not like me? Maybe I shouldn't have waved\\. \""""",thought
This is my break why are you talking about work stuff?,thought
It means that this is my time don't use it your way. It says that I am well aware of boundaries between my personal needs and work,thought
What a liar,thought
It means they are not actually that interested in hanging out with me and it would reflect on how I might see myself. ,thought
This is not fair I was totally the best applicant,thought
It means I was super confident in how the interview went and it shows my confidence ,thought
I seems they never really wanted to work this out.,thought
"It means it is time to move on because they were never really invested in the first place. It could reflect poorly on my emotional availability, but this is speculative.",thought

Finding another job is a lot of work and means a lot of uncertainty.,thought

I'm afraid she's going to die soon.,thought
My father died a few years ago and it was pretty heart wrenching and horrible and the thought of losing another loved one is very distressing.,thought

Eager to get to know them outside of work but they will not let me. ,thought
I sense a possible new friend but it is out of reach.,thought
The fact I don't see them often and didn't make arrangements to facilitate their visit. ,thought
Yes.  I would have guilt because I only see them twice a year on average and they rarely come see me.  ,thought
Feel like I'm not good enough,thought
I'd feel like I wasn't a good employee and not desired by others.  ,thought
That I wasn't valued as much as the other person. ,thought
It'd mean I wasn't as good as them.  I am competitive and want to be the best. ,thought
My boss thinks little of me and my abilities to lead.  ,thought
Not being able to succedd. Not being successful,thought
I will keep trying to work out ,thought

How people view me. My socioeconomic status. ,thought
I would be alone. ,thought

It would say something I am doing is giving the impression I'm not capable of doing the job required on my own.,thought
I would have to figure out what about the way I do things is giving the wrong impression that I need to be coached on every step.,thought

I would immediately start to look at the past and determine what caused the relationship to fail.,thought
It would show that I must have missed some earlier signs that things were failing.,thought

that I'm unlikeable. ,thought
that I'm always going to be alone.,thought
that my life is hopeless and I'll never have  real friends.,thought
That the co-worker has created an excuse to avoid an awkward interaction and feeling pressured into expanding the relationship. ,thought
It would say that I have misjudged the situation and probably overreached in attempting to create a more intimate relationship. This would make matters awkward at work. ,thought
I would think that maybe the diet was falsely-advertised. I would probably become immediately skeptical about the merits of this diet plan and whether it actually works. ,thought
I don't know that it would say very much about me. But it would tell me that I either need to work harder to maintain the diet or give it up entirely. ,thought
I would feel that I was not qualified or good enough for the position. I would become intensely critical of why I was receiving these rejection phone calls. ,thought
It would mean that I have not been in the necessary effort to receive a positive response from these employers. This would say that I have not put in my due-diligence - or that I need to attain additional qualifications before seeking these types of jobs. ,thought
It would mean that I need to re-evaluate and change how I apply for positions - and what skills that I am emphasizing to potential recruiters. ,thought
I would feel that the host didn't value my company - and probably shouldn't have invited me to this party where I didn't know anybody. I would be frustrated and a little angry with this person.,thought
It would again say that I have perhaps misjudged our relationship - and that we do not have as close of a friendship as I had initially presumed. This would cause me to pull-back and reevaluate whether I want to have a relationship with this person. ,thought
I felt that my personal self was under attack - and I needed to retaliate by denying their attack.,thought
It would say that my friendship with this person was more vulnerable than I had thought - and that we did not understand each other on a similar wavelength. It would also demonstrate that we have some underlying negative emotions that needed to be expressed.,thought

My family does is not being considerate of the demands placed on my time. ,thought
"I have a very demanding job, and at times, I am asked to work longer hours. When this is the case, I barely have time to spend with my wife and kids let alone other relatives. It's unfair to expect me to be available for everyone at any time. ",thought
My family will begin to resent me because they have a very aristocratic personality and always expect to get their way. ,thought
They'll want me to come crawling back and apologize because they feel I disrespected them for not making time to fit their schedule. ,thought

"I had gotten my hopes up about this job as it would allow me to continue doing the same type of work I do now, which I thoroughly enjoy, yet the pay and benefits would've been substantially better.  ",thought
Getting this job would've allowed me to better provide for my family financially. ,thought
Our finances would've become much less tight and my wife could've stayed home with the kids like she wanted since my income would cover her student loans. ,thought
"We could've bought a larger house which would've allowed us to acquire ducks, chickens, and plant a much larger garden, thereby allowing us to better provide our own food. ",thought

"It feels like it devalues me as a human being, knowing that someone I like chooses to ignore me rather than just briefly explain why they can't talk.",thought

I am afraid of what my boss would think of me.,thought
The worst that could happen is I get fired. It means that I care about what my superiors think about me. It says that I care too much about what others think.,thought
I would feel as though all my hard work was for nothing.,thought
"It would be upsetting because I worked so hard to try and lose weight, and just gained weight. It means that I let setbacks get me angry, which isn't very good.",thought

That I wanted to get a job and there was none,thought
It would say that I am not qualified enough,thought
It would say that I was not good enough to be hired,thought
I would want to know what went wrong,thought
It would mean that I ignored the situation too long and I did something wrong,thought
It would mean that I was not really a good partner,thought
What did I do wrong for him to ignore me,thought
That I would not be accepted by others in the party and I would be asked to leave,thought
It would say that I was not included in a group,thought
This is not a good time for this to happen,thought
I would not be able to afford the repair and I would need to figure out how to get it replaced,thought
It would say that I would not know how to move forward. ,thought
That I did not prepare well enough,thought
My coworker doesn't want to hang out with me.,thought
My coworker doesn't like me.,thought

I will feel left out.,thought
She doesn't respect me. ,thought
"She thinks that I should just jump up whenever she beeps her horn, no matter what I'm doing.",thought
She doesn't respect the fact that I work from home. ,thought
My time and work aren't valuable. ,thought
I feel devalued in the eyes of someone that I respect. ,thought
This is hopeless.,thought
"Yes, it would mean that I'm doomed to a bosy I dislike and poor health for the rest of my life. ",thought
This would mean that I would never see my goals come true. ,thought
Why am I not good enough?,thought
It would make me feel like all of my work and effort were useless.,thought
This would mean that I've been putting my heart and soul into basically nothing and would be looking at a life barely worth living. ,thought
Because I would not see much hope for the future. ,thought
He's... gone.,thought
That a relationship I had put so much effort into was completely ruined and nothing I could do could stop it.,thought
This would mean I am grieving a loss and having to try to learn how to live as a single unit again. ,thought
Why did he invite me?,non-thought
It would say that I don't seem to be a priority to this friend.,thought
Because it means someone I care about doesn't value my friendship.,thought
I never get to see her anymore.,thought
"It means that the relationship with my family is fading, which would be highly distressing.",thought
The worst that could happen is that a tragedy strikes and I never get to spend quality time with her again. ,thought
I'm well aware of the job to be done,thought
The boss is probably scornful of me taking a break,thought
"The boss is in the breakroom, too, but I can't point that out to him.",thought
This hypocrisy is irritating.,thought
...but I still need to appear productive at work,thought
"Is she truly busy, or just rejecting my invitation?",thought
I may have struck out,thought
She may simply not be interested in dating me,thought
I should respect her wishes,thought
I need to write this essay but I just can't do it!,thought
I may not be able to finish the task at hand,thought
I will severely disappoint those who are waiting for this essay.,thought
I may lose my job if I can't finish the work as assigned,thought
"If I lose my job, I could fall into severe poverty",thought
I never meant to hurt their feelings,thought
I had behaved inconsiderately,thought
I should have known better,thought
"\You had to come through right this minute?!\\\""""",non-thought
I had caused a problem for someone else,thought
This happened because of my own irresponsible behavior,thought
"Even in my inner monologue, I somehow thought it was the responsible party's fault",thought
Sometimes we are all hypocrites,thought
I really needed to lose weight for an upcoming event and felt angry that instead I gained weight.,thought
I would feel like I had failed at accomplishing a goal that was important to me.  I would feel like a failure and feel like I would never lose weight.,thought
I really need a job and it would make me sad to be rejected for several jobs.,thought
"I would be upset because not having a job means I can't pay rent, buy food, pay for gas, etc.  I would feel like there was something wrong with me that I can't get hired for a job.",thought
I would feel afraid of being alone.,thought
You get used to having a spouse or lover in your life.  It feels empty and alone when that person is no longer part of your life.  The worst that could happen is that I would never have another significant person in my life and would be alone for the rest of my life.  I would feel unloved and kind of worthless.,thought
My husband was being a jerk and not listening to me.,thought
"To me it means that my life is not important to my husband. Since I put up with this behavior, I think it says that I am weak and should instead speak up for myself.",thought
I would feel sad that someone I liked apparently did not feel the same way.,thought
I would wonder if I had done something to make this person not like me.  I would feel like something might be wrong with me.  I would probably feel depressed.,thought
A short break shouldn't be asking too much during a work day.,thought
Maybe my boss thinks my work is poor and taking a break is unwise.,thought
I could be fired.,thought
They don't like me as much as I like them.,thought
We aren't friends.,thought
I'm never going to get a job.,thought
I'm not going to make any money.,thought
I'll never be financially independent.,thought
My bills will never get paid.,thought
I'll never be free.,thought

She'll lose a day of pay at her job.,thought

i would immediately focus on getting the job done,thought
it would show that i am a hard worker and i am determined to get things done on time.,thought
the remorse and guilt i felt for upsetting my family and hurting their feelings,thought
yes it would upset me because it means that i let them down.,thought
i felt that i wasn't good enough,thought
it would mean i lacked confidence because i didn't have the experience for the job,thought
i realized i had wasted a week and was now way behind,thought
it said that i had not paid attention and focused on the wrong project.,thought
the worst that could happen was i had to start from scratch on the project i was supposed to be done with.,thought
the thought of being forgotten or unliked,thought
it would say i placed too much importance in the thoughts of others,thought
the impotence of not being able to formulate sentences,thought
means that I am very deconcentrated while I am trying to do this task,thought
not having met the expectations of employment,thought
it means that I'm not ready for this job,thought
the imprudence of the host,thought
means that the host does not want me to make friends,thought
the anger of having broken the coffee cup,thought
means that an important object for me broke,thought

"I'm usually able to put pen to paper efficiently, so having writers block would mean that I'm failing at a task I'm usually good at.",thought
I'm growing older and my cognitive function is slowly declining.,thought
It would be upsetting because I haven't accomplished what I desired out of life so far.,thought
I owe something to my family.,thought
It means I care about them as I didn't intend to hurt their feelings.,thought
"I'm a poor communicator and have failed to adequetly express myself in a manner that conveyed the meaning I intended (I meant \not right now,\\ not \\""never\\"")\""""",thought
I have some personal growth I need to accomplish.,thought
I am unemployable.,thought
It means I cannot pay my bills.,thought
I'm a failure.,thought
My wife doesn't love me.,thought
Because they're the person I care about most.,thought
It means I'm unloveable.,thought
It means that I don't believe I'm a good person.,thought
No one will ever love me.,thought
She doesn't trust me.,thought
I've betrayed her trust in some manner in the past.,thought
I let down the person I care about the most.,thought
What if they're not interested in me.,thought
I'd feel that I'm unattractive.,thought
I'll never meet anyone.,thought
I'll end up alone.,thought
I was fired and not given a chance to succeed.,thought
I could have done better if given some time.,thought
I can perform well if I'm allowed the time.,thought
I don't have what it takes to succeed.,thought
It would mean that I'm incompetent.,thought
I lack skill in my work.,thought
I don't have what it takes to succeed.,thought
They will get defensive if I bring up this issue.,thought
I'm too controlling or nagging.,thought
I'm only concerned with what matters to me.,thought

They didn't want to speak with me.,thought
I'm not a interesting person.,thought
I'll never be cool.,thought
I won't make any friends.,thought

I am irritated because my supervisor thinks that I have forgotten about work that needs to be completed and thinks that I'm slacking.,thought
My supervisor doesn't trust me to get work completed within established deadlines or feels that I'm not being competent.,thought
Supervisor's behavior means that they don't trust me or thinks I'm not doing a good enough job.,thought
Not feeling trust or not being competent at my work would make me feel like a bad person.,thought
"I did not feel like I was competent or performing well in my job, which led to my termination.",thought
It would feel like a slight to my character. I would feel that my supervisor is not able to rely on me.,thought
It would make me feel like a less-than-ideal person,thought
I would be extremely hurt that my spouse didn't want to have a conversation with me about trying to work on the relationship and isn't making an effort to salvage the relationship. I would also be hurt about him moving out without any prior notice and his stonewalling behavior.,thought
"I would feel upset that my spouse doesn't respect my opinions or feelings, and doesn't want to hear what I had to say, or doesn't think that I have the emotional capacity to empathize or validate his feelings or concerns about the relationship.",thought
"It is upsetting because that makes me feel like I was more emotionally invested in the relationship, and would make me feel betrayed.",thought
It would be upsetting because it would have felt like a waste of time. I would also feel like I was undervalued as a partner or person in the relationship,thought
"I would feel awkward because I don't know whether the person doesn't like me, doesn't know me, or just simply isn't interested in me.",thought
"The worst that could happen is that the person goes to talk negatively about me to the new group of people. If that happened, I would be hurt but also would feel extremely vulnerable because it means that I care a lot about what people think.",thought
If people talked about me negatively the worst that could happen is that I don't make new friends. That wouldn't matter much to me and I would just leave the party. It would mean that I don't mind dissociating myself from strangers; at least I made the effort.,thought
I was worried because I knew that he had to drive home and wasn't sure if he would be able to gauge his drinking habits and make good decisions. I was also worried because I know he has attractive female colleagues who are known to party and was playing out the worst case scenario of him cheating on me.,thought
The worst is that my husband could've driven drunk or cheated on me.,thought
"My husband could've gotten a DUI or killed someone with his drunk driving, or I could've flew into a blind rage at my husband or the other woman for cheating on me. It would mean that I am a jealous person or married to an idiot.",thought
"If my husband got a DUI or killed someone, he would've gone to jail. If I flew into a violent rage, I would've gone to jail.",thought
My husband or I would've lost our jobs. It would be very hurtful to me because I like having a stable income.,thought
We would be homeless if we lost our jobs and it would mean that I would be returning to a state of poverty which I am actively trying to avoid.,thought
I will think my boss is not happy with me,thought
He will sack me,thought
"Since he is boss, he can decide to sack me at when he wants on the ground that i was lazy about my job and that will means, i will not be able to my bills again. ",thought
I am too low for the person and she is avoiding me for that reason.,thought
I will start to avoid that person and try to stay of his or her way because i would not want to be embarrass again,thought
I will meet her and tell her that she is no longer my friend,thought
My thought was: why was i not giving the position instead of giving it to another person? I felt insulted and look down on.,thought
Because i was qualify but was not giving the job,thought
I will feel left alone,thought
It means my kind of person are not in the party and i am on my own.,thought
I Felt relegated and rejected.,thought
Because she was not in any relationship as at when i ask her out. I could not see any reason that will make her reject me as a guy if not that she looked down on me.,thought
I'm never going to be able to lose weight,thought
I would keep on gaining weight which would say that I lack self control or resilience,thought
My presumed lack of self control and resilience could cost me career and romantic opportunities,thought
I could end up in a dead end job and/or I could die alone ,thought
I am a failure,thought
It would mean that I would never be able to succeed,thought
If i could never succeed I could never reach personal fulfillment,thought
I would die never having achieved happiness ,thought
Obviously he wasn't on the same intellectual level as me ,thought
My mom must favor her more than me ,thought

I'm at a job where I'll never been given due credit. ,thought
I'm wasting my time at my current job. ,thought
"I've already wasted a lot of time, given how long I've been here. ",thought
I must be gaining muscle or water weight,thought
It would say that I am doing well with my diet and I would wait for the following week to be upset,thought
I should have continued what I was doing before,thought
It would say I give up easily.,thought
It would mean that I will not progress in my life,thought
I should have listened more to what he had to say and tried to be better,thought

It says that I have an anxiety issue that I need to clear up and stop being afraid to ask for things.,thought
I could continue to not ask for help until I lose everything,thought
I guess they have better things to do right now,thought
Perhaps I had an expectation that they would want to socialize with me. If they were honestly too busy I would be okay with that response.,thought

Work triggered it mostly today. I spent almost all of today tracing a problem we thought we had resolved on Friday after a week of hassle.

"Its been quite a few hours since I’ve spoken to her. 
I dont think she realises how bad her reaction has affected me. 
I haven’t communicated to her since the altercation this morning (10am) of how upset i am with her but neither has she. 
I’m certain there was a miscommunication on her side and i know i tried my best trying to get her to see that during the heated chat. 
Im glad i remained calm but i dont think she realises how when shes angry she can really pick at parts of me. 
She tried to ask me how I was before i left for my walk but i couldn’t face her. 
I wasn’t in my right mind, especially after having a heated chat with my dad.
An apology would be nice but i feel i’ll be met with a case soon about how we need to talk about why she got pissed off with me first, why she did what she did and why it was necessary before she apologies for how “i received it”.

2) my partner got angry at me because I left her to go to my business venture. She was unavailable to buy a takeaway she wanted.

"This morning I was meant to go for a walk with my nan. I told her that nothing I wore felt right and that I was panicking but I really wanted to go for a walk to get out. I just needed someone there to talk to because it was overwhelming, but she just left to go on the walk. I feel really disappointed and I just don’t know what to do. I’ve done what I can over the past few months by talking to my nan and mum more and letting them know how they can help me when they’ve asked what to do. But at times when it’s the worst I just feel like saying all of it was for nothing. I know she can’t fix anything, to be honest I understand why she walked away, it must be too much. But I just feel like I needed someone there. 
I’ll try look after myself today instead. When the ocd is so intense like that, the only thing I can think to do to get the frustration out is to hit things. This doesn’t happen often now but I know it’s not something that will help me. So I think I’ll have a tea and do some crocheting before I do what I had planned today. ",non-thought
